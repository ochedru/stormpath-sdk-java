     * assigned account stores: in this case specifying an account store will result in a direct (targeted)
     * authentication which would be faster because
     * Stormpath does not need to iteratively try each assigned account store
     * <a href="http://docs.stormpath.com/java/product-guide/#account-store-mappings">as documented</a>.
     *
