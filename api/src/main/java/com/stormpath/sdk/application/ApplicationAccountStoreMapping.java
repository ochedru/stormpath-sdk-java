/**
 * An {@code ApplicationAccountStoreMapping} represents the assignment of an {@link AccountStore AccountStore} (either a {@link Group Group}, {@link com.stormpath.sdk.organization.Organization Organization} or
 * {@link Directory Directory}) to an {@link Application Application}.
 * <p/>
 * When an {@code ApplicationAccountStoreMapping} is created, the accounts in the account store are granted access to (become users
 * of) the linked {@code Application}.  The {@link #getListIndex() order} in which {@code AccountStore}s are assigned
 * to an application determines <a href="http://docs.stormpath.com/rest/product-guide/#account-store-mappings">how
 * login attempts work in Stormpath</a>.
 * <h2>Default Account Store</h2>
 * Additionally, an {@code ApplicationAccountStoreMapping} may be designated as the {@link #isDefaultAccountStore() defaultAccountStore}.
 * This causes any accounts created directly by the application to be dispatched to and saved in the associated {@code AccountStore},
 * since Applications cannot store accounts directly.
 * <h2>Default Group Store</h2>
 * Similarly, an {@code ApplicationAccountStoreMapping} may be designated as the {@link #isDefaultGroupStore() defaultGroupStore}.
 * This causes any groups created directly by the application to be dispatched to and saved in the associated {@code AccountStore},
 * since an Application cannot store groups directly.
 * <b>Note:</b> A Group cannot store other Groups.  Therefore, the default group store must be a {@code Directory}.
