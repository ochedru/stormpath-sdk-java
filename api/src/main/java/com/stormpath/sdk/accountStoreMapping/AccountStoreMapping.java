     * <h3>Authentication Process and AccountStoreMapping Order</h3>
     * During an authentication attempt, an Application or Organization consults its mapped account stores in <em>iteration order</em>,
     * trying to find the first matching account to use for authentication.  The lower the {@code AccountStoreMapping}
     * index (closer to zero), the earlier that store is consulted during authentication.  If no matching account is
     * found in an account store, the application/organization will move on to the next {@code AccountStore} (next highest index)
     * in the list.  This continues either a matching account is found, or until all account stores are exhausted.
     * When a matching account is found, the process is short-circuited and the discovered account will be used
     * immediately for authentication.
     * <p/>
     * When calling this method, you control where the new {@code AccountStoreMapping} will reside in the Application's or Organization's
     * overall list by setting its (zero-based) listIndex property before calling this
     * method.
     * <h4>{@code listIndex} values</h4>
     * <ul>
     * <li>negative: attempting to set a negative {@code listIndex} will cause an Error</li>
     * <li>zero: the account store mapping will be the first item in the list (and therefore consulted first
     * during the authentication process).</li>
     * <li>positive: the account store mapping will be inserted at that index.  Because list indices are zero-based,
     * the account store will be in the list at position {@code listIndex - 1}.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Any {@code listIndex} value equal to or greater than the current list size will automatically append the
     * {@code ApplicationAccountStoreMapping} at the end of the list.
     * <h4>Example</h4>
     * Setting a new {@code AccountStoreMapping}'s {@code listIndex} to {@code 500} and then adding the mapping to
     * an application/organization with an existing 3-item list will automatically save the {@code AccountStoreMapping} at the end
     * of the list and set its {@code listIndex} value to {@code 3} (items at index 0, 1, 2 were the original items,
     * the new fourth item will be at index 3).
