     * This test asserts three things:
     *
     * 1.  When iterating over a paginated collection, and each page is totally full (i.e. the page limit is equal to
     *     the last page's items array size), that the number of accounts is the same number as expected, and
     *
     * 2.  When iterating over a new instance of the same collection (i.e. a new query is executed), and the page limit
     *     is greater than the last page's items array size (last page is not totally full), that the number of
     *     accounts is the same number as expected.
     *
     * 3.  When each collection element has a collection expansion enabled (i.e. get a list of accounts and each
     *     account has its groups collection expanded), that the same number of requests to the server occur.  In
     *     other words, iterating over a collection when its elements also have an expanded collection does not incur
     *     additional requests for the nested collections.
     *
     * This ensures that collection iteration always exhausts the entire collection regardless of how pages are
     * chunked.
     *
     * These three things could have been asserted as separate tests, but were written as one so that we don't have
     * to hammer the API servers more than necessary.
