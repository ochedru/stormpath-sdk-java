/**
 * Helps build a URL you can use to redirect your application users to a hosted login/registration/forgot-password site
 * - what Stormpath calls an 'Identity Site' (or 'ID Site' for short) - for performing common user identity
 * functionality.  When the user is done (logging in, registering, etc), they will be redirected back to a
 * {@link #setCallbackUri(String) callbackUri} of your choice.
 *
 * <h5>Retaining Application State</h5>
 *
 * <p>If you need to retain application state, such as the location in your UI the user is attempting to visit, and you
 * want that state presented back to you when the user returns from the ID Site, you can use the {@link
 * #setState(String) setState(aString)} method.  This state will be retained while the user is on the ID Site, and
 * the exact same state will be available when the user returns to your application's {@code callbackUri}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code state} property, while sent over TLS/SSL and cryptographically signed, is guaranteed that it will not
 * be tampered with or manipulated in any way.  However, it itself is not additionally encrypted and might be
 * accessible
 * as a URL query parameter for anyone that can see the URL.  As such, it is recommended that you do not store
 * secure state in this value unless you encrypt it first.</p>
