Events
======

The |project| will trigger events when interesting things happen.  You can listen for these events and implement custom behavior when desired.

RequestEventListener
--------------------

When the |project| publishes various events, a ``RequestEventListener`` will be notified.  If you want to listen for events, you can implement your own ``RequestEventListener`` in one of two ways:

#. Implement the ``com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.event.RequestEventListener`` interface directly and implement all event methods.
#. Subclass the ``com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.event.RequestEventListenerAdapter`` and override only the event methods you are interested in.

.. only:: servlet

  You may specify your implementation's fully qualified class name using the ``stormpath.web.event.listener`` configuration property:

  .. code-block:: properties

      stormpath.web.request.event.listener = com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.event.RequestEventListenerAdapter

  As you can see, the default implementation is an instance of the adapter, which simply just logs each event to the ``debug`` log level.

.. only:: springboot

  After you have an implementation, just declare your implementation as the ``stormpathRequestEventListener`` bean:

  .. code-block:: java

      @Bean
      public RequestEventListener stormpathRequestEventListener() {
          return new RequestEventListenerAdapter();
      }

  Unless overridden, the default implementation is an instance of the adapter, which simply just logs each event to the ``debug`` log level.

Events
------

The events currently published by the |project| are:

======================================== ==============================================================================
Event Class                              Published when processing an HTTP request that:
======================================== ==============================================================================
``SuccessfulAuthenticationRequestEvent`` successfully authenticates an ``Account``
``FailedAuthenticationRequestEvent``     attempts to authenticate an ``Account`` but the authentication attempt failed
``RegisteredAccountRequestEvent``        results in a newly registered ``Account``.  If the newly registered account
                                         requires email verification before it can login,
                                         ``event.getAccount().getStatus() == AccountStatus.UNDEFINED`` will be ``true``
``VerifiedAccountRequestEvent``          verifies an account's email address.  The event's associated account is
                                         considered verified and may login to the application.
``LogoutRequestEvent``                   will logout the request's associated ``Account``.  After the request is
                                         complete, the account will be logged out.
======================================== ==============================================================================

Listener Best Practices
-----------------------

Events are sent and consumed *synchronously* during the HTTP request that triggers them.

To ensure requests are responded to quickly, ensure your event listener methods return quickly or dispatch work asynchronously to another thread or ``ExecutorService`` (for example).

.. only:: springboot

  Spring Security
  ---------------

  If you are using our `Spring Security integration <https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-java/tree/master/extensions/spring/stormpath-spring-security-webmvc>`_ then the standard Spring Security events will be triggered as usual.

  .. note::

      Authentication event publishing is delegated to the configured ``AuthenticationEventPublisher`` which defaults to a null implementation which doesn't publish events, so you must inject a publisher bean if you want to receive Spring Security events.

  In the case of a successful authentication an `AuthenticationSuccessEvent <http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-security/4.1.2.RELEASE/apidocs/org/springframework/security/authentication/event/AuthenticationSuccessEvent.html>`_ will be triggered. Otherwise, one of many different events denoting the actual authentication failure cause will be triggered.
