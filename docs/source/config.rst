No Config?
----------

Refreshingly, the |project| doesn't require any configuration at all as long as the following conditions apply:

.. only:: servlet

  #. You added the stormpath-servlet-plugin .jar and its transitive dependencies to your web application's ``/WEB-INF/lib`` directory.  This happens automatically if you use a Maven-compatible build tool like Maven or Gradle to :ref:`specify the stormpath-servlet-plugin dependency <servlet-plugin-jar>` in your project build configuration.
  #. Your web application can read the ``$HOME/.stormpath/apiKey.properties`` file :ref:`mentioned in the Quickstart <get-api-key>`.
  #. You have only one Application registered with Stormpath.

.. only:: springboot

  #. You added the |project| .jar and its transitive dependencies to your web application's ``/WEB-INF/lib`` directory.  This happens automatically if you use a Maven-compatible build tool like Maven or Gradle to :ref:`specify the stormpath-thymeleaf-spring-boot-starter dependency <dependency-jar>` in your project build configuration.
  #. Your web application can read the ``$HOME/.stormpath/apiKey.properties`` file :ref:`mentioned in the Quickstart <get-api-key>`.
  #. You have only one Application registered with Stormpath.

If all of these conditions cannot be met, then you will have to specify some minimal configuration (but not much!) as described below.

.. only:: servlet

  web.xml
  -------

  Most plugin users do not need to modify the web application ``/WEB-INF/web.xml`` file to enable the plugin - just adding the plugin .jar to your web application's ``lib`` directory is usually sufficient.

  However, some applications might experience a filter chain conflict that causes problems.

  At application startup, the Stormpath Java Servlet Plugin automatically enables a ``StormpathFilter`` to handle various request flows.  If your web application uses frameworks that make heavy use of servlet filters, like Spring MVC or Apache Shiro, these existing filters might cause an ordering conflict with the ``StormpathFilter``.

  If you are experiencing problems after adding the stormpath-servlet-plugin .jar to your web app's classpath, you'll need to explicitly specify where the ``StormpathFilter`` should reside in your application's filter chain.  Luckily the fix is really easy:

  Simply specify the following XML chunk in ``/WEB-INF/web.xml`` relative to other filter mappings that are already enabled in your application:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <filter-mapping>
            <filter-name>StormpathFilter</filter-name>
            <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
        </filter-mapping>

  It is often easiest to specifying this at or near the top of your other filter mappings.  The ``StormpathFilter`` will ignore all filtered requests that do not match recognized URL rules, allowing other frameworks to filter requests as necessary.

  stormpath.properties
  --------------------

  If you need to customize behavior, the Stormpath Java Servlet Plugin uses a very simple ``.properties`` based configuration format and supports a convenient override mechanism using various property definition locations.

  All stormpath configuration properties are prefixed with ``stormpath.`` and take the following form (for example)

  .. code-block:: properties

      stormpath.some.property.name = aValue
      stormpath.another.property.name = anotherValue

  etc.

  .. _stormpath.properties locations:

  Property Locations
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can define stormpath property values in a number of locations.  This allows you to define a core set of properties in a primary configuration file and override values as necessary using other locations.

  Configuration property values are read from the following locations, *in order*.  Values discovered in locations later (further down in the list) will automatically override values found in previous locations:

  .. contents::
     :local:
     :depth: 2

  If you're just starting out, we recommend that your configuration be specified in ``/WEB-INF/stormpath.properties`` and you use Environment Variables to specify password or secret values (e.g. for production environments).

  Defining properties in these locations is covered more in detail next.

  1. Plugin web.stormpath.properties
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  This file resides in the stormpath-servlet-plugin-|version|.jar at:

   ``/com/stormpath/sdk/servlet/config/web.stormpath.properties``

  It includes all of the plugin's default configuration and is not modifiable.  The default values within can be overridden by specifying properties in locations read later during the startup process.

  2. classpath:stormpath.properties
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If a ``stormpath.properties`` file exists at the root of your web application's classpath (typically in ``/WEB-INF/classes`` or at the root of one of your .jar files in ``/WEB-INF/lib``), ``stormpath.*`` properties will be read from that file and override any identically-named properties discovered previously.

  .. NOTE::
     Because this is not a web-specific location, it is only recommended to use this location if you wish to share stormpath properties configuration across multiple projects in a 'resource .jar' that is used in such projects.

  3. /WEB-INF/stormpath.properties
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If a file ``/WEB-INF/stormpath.properties`` exists in your web application, properties will be read from this file and override any identically-named properties discovered in previous locations.

  .. TIP::
     This is the recommended primary configuration location for most web applications.

  4. Servlet Context Parameters
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you define ``stormpath.*`` servlet context parameters in your web application's ``/WEB-INF/web.xml`` file, they will override any identically-named properties discovered in previous locations.  For example:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <context-param>
          <param-name>stormpath.properties</param-name>
          <param-value><![CDATA[
              stormpath.foo.bar = myValue
              stormpath.other.prop = another value
          ]]></param-value>
      </context-param>

  5. Environment Variables
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  You may use Environment Variables to specify or override your application's ``stormpath.*`` properties using an all uppercase + underscore convention.

  For example, let's assume there is a property named ``stormpath.foo.bar`` that you would might specify in a file:

  .. code-block:: properties

      stormpath.foo.bar = myValue

  If you wanted to specify this property as an environment variable, you would change all characters to uppercase and replace all period characters ``.`` with underscores ``_``. The above example then becomes:

  ``STORMPATH_FOO_BAR=myValue``

  For example, using the bash shell on a \*nix operating system:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ export STORMPATH_FOO_BAR=myValue


  6. JVM System Properties
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you define ``stormpath.*`` system properties (using ``-D`` flags when starting the java process), they will override any identically-named properties discovered in previous locations.  For example:

  ``-Dstormpath.foo.bar=myValue``

  .. _stormpath.properties security considerations:

  Security Considerations: Passwords and secret values
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It is **strongly** recommended that you do not specify the ``stormpath.client.apiKey.secret`` property - or any other password or secret property - in shared files such as ``classpath:stormpath.properties``, ``/WEB-INF/stormpath.properties``, or ``web.xml``. These files are usually committed to version control (like git) and shared with other developers.

  Because Stormpath API Keys are always assigned to an individual person, they should never be shared with or visible to anyone else, not even other co-workers or even Stormpath employees.  Anyone that has your API Key id and secret can alter the data in your Stormpath tenant.

  Also, it should also be noted that, while JVM System Properties are not usually visible to other developers, using System Properties for secrets and passwords can also be seen as a security risk: system property values are visible to anyone performing a process listing on a production machine (e.g. ``ps aux | grep java``).

  If you cannot rely on accessing the default ``$HOME/.stormpath/apiKey.properties`` file, Environment Variables or a different private local file (with restricted read permissions) is usually a safer alternative when defining passwords or secret values than shared files or JVM System Properties.

.. only:: springboot

  Property Overrides
  ------------------

  Wherever possible, sane default configuration values are used to automatically configure Stormpath beans loaded by Spring.

  If you wish to override any of these defaults, you can do so by overriding properties in your Spring Boot `application.properties`_ locations.  In most cases, setting a configuration property will be all that is necessary - most of all of the default Stormpath bean implementations are highly configurable with property values.  If you need even finer control, you may wish to re-define a Stormpath bean entirely to provide your own implementation as discussed in the next section below.

  All Stormpath configuration properties are prefixed with ``stormpath.`` and take the following form (for example):

  .. code-block:: properties

      stormpath.some.property.name = aValue
      stormpath.another.property.name = anotherValue

  Simply just re-define the relevant ``stormpath.``\* property in one of your Spring Boot `application.properties`_ locations and your value will be used instead of the default.

  .. _property security considerations:

  Security Considerations: Passwords and secret values
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It is **strongly** recommended that you do not specify the ``stormpath.client.apiKey.secret`` property - or any other password or secret property - in shared properties files. These files are usually committed to version control (like git) and shared with other developers.

  Because Stormpath API Keys are always assigned to an individual person, they should never be shared with or visible to anyone else, not even other co-workers or even Stormpath employees.  Anyone that has your API Key id and secret can alter the data in your Stormpath tenant.

  Also, it should also be noted that, while JVM System Properties are not usually visible to other developers, using System Properties for secrets and passwords can also be seen as a security risk: system property values are visible to anyone performing a process listing on a production machine (e.g. ``ps aux | grep java``).

  If you cannot rely on accessing the default ``$HOME/.stormpath/apiKey.properties`` file, Environment Variables or a different private local file (with restricted read permissions) is usually a safer alternative when defining passwords or secret values than shared files or JVM System Properties.


  Bean Overrides
  --------------

  If property overrides are not sufficient or you need even finer control, you may wish to re-define a Stormpath bean entirely and provide your own custom implementation.

  To do so, you just need to re-define that bean in your own Spring Boot Java configuration.  Often certain bean names must be retained, so if you re-define a bean, try to use the same name and your bean will be used instead of the default.

  For example, assume a bean named ``stormpathJwtFactory`` existed.  To use your own implementation instead of the Stormpath default, just redefine the bean in your project's Java Config.  For example:

  .. code-block:: java

      @Bean
      public JwtFactory stormpathJwtFactory() {
          return new MyJwtFactory();
      }

  A ``MyJwtFactory`` instance will be used instead of the default.

Stormpath Client
----------------

The |project| depends on a Stormpath ``Client`` instance to communicate with Stormpath for most functionality.  You may configure the client via ``stormpath.*`` properties as necessary.

API Key
~~~~~~~

The API Key used by the SDK Client will be acquired from the following locations.  Locations inspected later override previously discovered values.

.. only:: servlet

  * ``$HOME/.stormpath/apiKey.properties`` file
  * Any ``stormpath.client.apiKey.id`` value discovered from inspected :ref:`property locations <stormpath.properties locations>`
  * Any ``stormpath.client.apiKey.secret`` value discovered from inspected :ref:`property locations <stormpath.properties locations>`

.. only:: springboot

  * ``$HOME/.stormpath/apiKey.properties`` file
  * Any ``stormpath.client.apiKey.id`` value discovered from Spring property placeholder locations
  * Any ``stormpath.client.apiKey.secret`` value discovered from Spring property placeholder locations

.. caution::
   While ``stormpath.client.apiKey.secret`` can be configured as a property in a file, please be aware of the :ref:`security considerations <stormpath.properties locations>` of files shared with other people.

HTTP Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~

If your application requires communication to Stormpath go through an HTTP Proxy, you can set the following configuration properties as needed:

* ``stormpath.client.proxy.host``: Proxy server hostname or IP address, e.g. ``proxy.mycompany.com`` or ``10.0.2.88``.
* ``stormpath.client.proxy.port``: Proxy server port, for example ``8888``.
* ``stormpath.client.proxy.username``: Username to use when connecting to the proxy server.  Only configure this property if proxy server username/password authentication is required.
* ``stormpath.client.proxy.password``: Password to use when connecting to the proxy server.  Only configure this property if proxy server username/password authentication is required, but **note**: it is strongly recommended that you don't embed passwords in text files. You might want to specify this property as an environment variable, for example:

 .. code-block:: bash

    export STORMPATH_CLIENT_PROXY_PASSWORD=your_proxy_server_password

Authentication Scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Stormpath SDK Client communicates with Stormpath using a very secure `cryptographic digest`_-based authentication scheme.

If you deploy your app on Google App Engine however, you might experience some problems.  You can change the scheme to use ``basic`` authentication by setting the following configuration property and value:

.. code-block:: properties

   stormpath.client.authenticationScheme = basic

If your application is not deployed on Google App Engine, we recommend that you *do not* set this property.

.. only:: springboot

  Caching
  ~~~~~~~

  The client caches resources from the Stormpath API server by default in an in-memory, in-process cache to enhance performance.

  .. caution::

      If your application is deployed across multiple JVMs (e.g. clustered or striped) the default caching mechanism could cause problems because each application instance would have its *own* cache.  This could cause data consistency problems across the application instances.

  You can either disable the cache entirely or configure your own coherent or cluster-friendly Spring ``CacheManager`` and that would be used for the Stormpath Client's needs automatically.

  Please see the :ref:`Caching <caching>` chapter for more information.

Usage
~~~~~

.. only:: servlet

  After application startup, you may access the ``Client`` instance if desired using the ``ClientResolver`` and referencing the web application's ``ServletContext``:

  .. code-block:: java

     import com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.client.ClientResolver;
     //...

     Client client = ClientResolver.INSTANCE.getClient(servletContext);

.. only:: springboot

  You may access the ``Client`` instance via normal Spring autowiring.  For example:

  .. code-block:: java

     @Autowired
     private Client client;

You can also :ref:`access the client via a ServletRequest <request sdk client>`.

Stormpath Application
---------------------

The |project| requires that your web application correspond to a registered ``Application`` record within Stormpath.

If you only have one registered application with Stormpath, |project| will automatically query Stormpath at startup, find the ``Application`` and use it, and no configuration is necessary.

However, if you have more than one application registered with Stormpath, you must configure the ``href`` of the specific application to access by setting the following configuration property:

.. code-block:: properties

   stormpath.application.href = your_application_href_here

You can find your application's href in the `Stormpath Admin Console`_:

#. Click on the ``Applications`` tab and find your application in the list.  Click on the Application's name:

   .. image:: /_static/console-applications-ann.png

#. On the resulting *Application Details* page, the **REST URL** property value is your application's ``href``:

   .. image:: /_static/console-application-href.png

Usage
~~~~~

.. only:: servlet

  After application startup, you may access the ``Application`` instance if desired (for example, searching your application's user accounts, creating groups, etc) using the ``ApplicationResolver`` and referencing the web application's ``ServletContext``:

  .. code-block:: java

     import com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.application.ApplicationResolver;
     //...

     Application myApp = ApplicationResolver.INSTANCE.getApplication(servletContext);

.. only:: springboot

  You may access the ``Application`` instance if desired (for example, searching your application's user accounts, creating groups, etc) using normal Spring autowiring:

  .. code-block:: java

     @Autowired
     private Application application;

You can also :ref:`access the application via a ServletRequest <request application>`.

.. only:: servlet

  .. _filters:

  Filters
  -------

  The Stormpath Java Servlet Plugin works largely by intercepting requests to certain URI paths in your application and then executing one or more servlet filters based on the URI being accessed.

  All of the Servlet Filters needed by the plugin are already configured, but if you wanted to, you could define your own Servlet Filters (or even override the plugin's defaults) as configuration properties via the following convention:

  .. code-block:: properties

      stormpath.web.filters.FILTER_NAME = FULLY_QUALFIED_CLASS_NAME

  where:

  * ``FILTER_NAME`` is a unique String name of the filter.
  * ``FULLY_QUALIFIED_CLASS_NAME`` is your ``javax.servlet.Filter`` implementation fully qualified class name, for example, ``com.whatever.foo.MyFilter``.

  .. tip::
     Any ``Filter`` implementation may be specified!

     However, if you need to implement a new filter, you might find it easier to subclass the ``com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.filter.HttpFilter`` class: it provides some nice conveniences, like enabling/disabling and the ability to access Stormpath configuration properties if necessary.

  You control which filters are executed, and the order they are executed, by declaring URI patterns, covered below.

  .. _default filters:

  Default Filters
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The plugin contains some useful filter implementations pre-configured and ready to use in your URI pattern chains:

  =========== ======================================================================= =========================================================================
  Filter Name Filter Class                                                            Description
  =========== ======================================================================= =========================================================================
  ``anon``    ``com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.filter.AnonymousFilter``                    'anon'ymous users are allowed (anyone). Mostly useful for exclusion rules
  ``authc``   ``com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.filter.AuthenticationFilter``               Requesting user must be authenticated. If not, redirect to login
                                                                                      or issue http authentication challenge depending on ``Accept``
                                                                                      header preference rules.
  ``account`` ``com.stormpath.sdk.servlet.filter.account.AccountAuthorizationFilter`` Requesting user must be a known user account and, optionally, must pass
                                                                                      one or more account-specific authorization expressions.
  =========== ======================================================================= =========================================================================

  .. _uris:

  URIs
  ----

  You can control which filters are executed for any application URI path by defining your own paths in ``stormpath.properties`` locations via the following convention:

  .. code-block:: properties

      stormpath.web.uris.URI_PATTERN = FILTER_CHAIN_DEFINITION

  where:

  * ``ROUTE_PATTERN`` is an `Ant-style path expression`_ that represents a URI path or path hierarchy (via wildcard ``*`` matching) relative to the web application's `context path`_.
  * ``FILTER_CHAIN_DEFINITION`` is a comma-delimited list of filter names that match the the names of the a :ref:`default filter <default filters>` or any manually defined filter as described  :ref:`above <filters>`

  For example:

  ``stormpath.web.uris./admin/** = foo, bar, baz``

  This configuration line indicates that any request to the `/admin` path or any of its children paths (via the ant-style wildcard of `/admin/**`), the ``foo`` filter should execute, then the ``bar`` filter should execute, then the ``baz`` filter should execute.  If the filters all allow the request to continue, then a servlet handler or controller will receive and process the request.

  Therefore, the comma-delimited list of filter names defines a *filter chain* that should execute for that specific URI path.  You can define as many URI filter chains as you wish based on your applications needs.

  .. TIP::
     Because URI patterns are relative to your web application's `context path`_, you can deploy your application to ``http://localhost:8080/myapp`` and then later deploy it to ``https://myapp.com`` without changing your URI configuration.

  .. _uri evaluation priority:

  URI Evaluation Priority
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  .. WARNING:: Order Matters!

     URI patterns are evaluated against an incoming request in the order they are defined, and the *FIRST MATCH WINS*.

     For example, let's assume there are the following path chain definitions:

     .. code-block:: properties

        /account/** = authc
        /account/signup = anon

     If an incoming request is intended to reach ``/account/signup`` (accessible by all 'anon'ymous users), *it will never be handled!*. The reason is that the ``/account/**`` pattern matched the incoming request first and 'short-circuited' all remaining definitions.

     Always remember to define your filter chains based on a *FIRST MATCH WINS* policy.
