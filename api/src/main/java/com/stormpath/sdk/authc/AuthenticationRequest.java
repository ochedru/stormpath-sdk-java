 * <p>While there can be multiple implementations of this interface (typically constructed by type-specific builders)
 * to reflect different type of authentication attempts, the most common scenario is when a user logs in to your
 * application with username-password authentication.  For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * String username = getUsername(httpServletRequest); //implement me
 * String password = getPassword(httpServletRequest); //implement me
 *
 * AuthenticationRequest authcRequest = {@link UsernamePasswordRequests#builder() UsernamePasswordRequests.builder()}.setUsername(username).setPassword(password).build();
 *
 * myApplication.{@link com.stormpath.sdk.application.Application#authenticateAccount(AuthenticationRequest)
 * authenticateAccount}(authcRequest);
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see com.stormpath.sdk.authc.UsernamePasswordRequests
 * @see com.stormpath.sdk.application.Application#authenticateAccount(AuthenticationRequest) Application.authenticateAccount(authcRequest)

     * documented</a>.</p>

     * should execute.
