.. ATTENTION::

   You may encounter a circular redirect in your Google Chrome browser when you are in the process of developing your
   Spring Boot + Spring Security + Stormpath application.

   This is due to a known issue with Google Chrome whereby it aggressively caches ``302`` redirects.

   The solution is to clear cache or use an Icognito window while testing.

   `Here <http://kmarsden.com/chrome-redirect-cache/>`_ a good post describing the issue and its solution further.

   **Note:** This will never occur in a production release environment.
