/**
 * The (read-only) Service Provider metadata that can be used to register an application (aka 'Service Provider) with
 * a SAML Identity Provider.
 * <p>This metadata is almost always accessed as an XML document (as described below) and
 * provided to the SAML Identity Provider when registering with the Identity Provider, and not often accessed
 * in Java code or as JSON.  However, it is provided in the Stormpath SDK as a type-safe resource should
 * you wish to read the associated values.</p>
 * <p>This instance is read-only.  Because Stormpath fully automates SAML assertion exchange between the
 * Identity Provider, there is nothing to configure, so there are no mutator (setter) methods necessary.</p>
 * <h5>SAML Metadata XML</h5>
 * <p>As mentioned above, most Identity Providers need the SAML metadata as an XML document.  To obtain that
 * document, simply execute an HTTP {@code GET} request to this resource's {@link #getHref() href} property.
 * For example:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 * String HREF_VALUE_HERE = samlServiceProviderMetadata.getHref();
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>This GET request might look like the following example:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 * GET HREF_VALUE_HERE HTTP/1.1
 * Host: api.stormpath.com
 * Content-Type: application/xml
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>(where HREF_VALUE_HERE is substituted with the actual href value)</p>
 * <p>The metadata will be returned as a SAML metadata XML document.</p>
