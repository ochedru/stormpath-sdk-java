Registration
============

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

Overview
--------

One of the very first things most web apps need is the ability to create a user account and login.  So how do we create user accounts?

1. Visit ``http://localhost:8080/register`` and you'll see the registration view:

.. image:: /_static/register.png

2. Fill out the form and click submit and you'll be redirected back to your application's root path, for example, ``http://localhost:8080/``.

Pretty nice!  Not a single line of code required. :)

And while we think the default look and feel of the pages automatically rendered by the plugin are pretty nice, you have full control over the CSS and HTML for these pages - we'll cover customizing them later.

URI
---

Users can self-register for your web application by visiting ``/register``

If you want to change this path, set the ``stormpath.web.register.uri`` configuration property:

.. code-block:: properties

    # The context-relative path to the register ('new user') view:
    stormpath.web.register.uri = /register

Next URI
--------
**If** ``stormpath.web.register.autoLogin = false`` **, this is the default**

If :ref:`email verification <email verification>` is disabled, a successfully registered user will be automatically redirected to the application's context root (home page) by default.  If you want to change this destination, set the ``stormpath.web.register.nextUri`` configuration property:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.nextUri = /

**If** ``stormpath.web.register.autoLogin = true``

If :ref:`email verification <email verification>` is disabled, a successfully registered user will be automatically logged in to the application and redirected to the page specified in the ``stormpath.web.login.nextUri`` configuration property:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.login.nextUri = /

Again, this property is only referenced if email verification is disabled.  If email verification is enabled, a page will be rendered asking the user to check their email.

Next Query Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If :ref:`email verification <email verification>` is disabled and the user is directed to the registration view (by clicking a link or via a redirect), and the URI has a ``next`` query parameter, the ``next`` query parameter value will take precedence as the post-registration redirect location. For example:

``https://myapp.com/register?next=/registerSuccess``

This will cause the user to be redirected ``/registerSuccess`` instead of the configured ``stormpath.web.register.nextUri`` path.

Again, this functionality is only executed if email verification is disabled.  If email verification is enabled, a page will be rendered asking the user to check their email.

.. only:: springboot

  View
  ----

  When the URI is visited a default template view named ``stormpath/register`` is rendered by default.  If you wanted to render your own template instead of the default, you can set the name of the template to render with the ``stormpath.web.register.view`` property:

  .. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.view = stormpath/register

  Remember that the property value is the *name* of a view, and the effective Spring ``ViewResolver`` will resolve that name to a template file.  See the :ref:`Custom Views <views>` chapter for more information.

Form Fields
-----------

You can specify a which form fields will be displayed by editing the ``stormpath.web.register.form.fields`` configuration property.  For example, the default value for ``givenName`` is:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.enabled = true
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.visible = true
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.label = stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.label
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.placeholder = stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.placeholder
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.required = true
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.type = text

By default the supported directives are:

* ``enabled``: the field is enabled for edit.
* ``visible``: the field is visible.
* ``label``: this is the label to display and its value is defined in i18n.properties with the key ``stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.label``.
* ``placeholder``: this is the placeholder to display and its value is defined in i18n.properties with the key ``stormpath.web.register.form.fields.givenName.placeholder``.
* ``required``: makes the field required, If the field is blank, the error message is defined in i18n.properties as ``stormpath.web.register.form.fields.email.required``. If the input is invalid the error message is in the i18n.properties with the key ``stormpath.web.register.form.fields.email.invalid``.
* ``type``: The input type of the field.

By default the supported fields are: (remember to set the directives for each one)

* ``givenName``: person's given name, also known as 'first name' in Western countries.
* ``middleName``: any middle name(s).
* ``surname``: person's family name, also known as 'last name' in Western countries.
* ``username``: a username.  If unspecified, Stormpath defaults the username to the ``email`` value.
* ``email``: the user's email address.  This field is always required.
* ``password``: the user's password.

You can customize this list of fields, those extra fields will be saved as custom data. The order field is defined in

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.form.fieldOrder = username,givenName,middleName,surname,email,password,confirmPassword

You can also customize additional directives as necessary, but note:

**The** ``email`` **form field is always required.  If you customize your form fields, ensure that you always have at least an** ``email`` **and set it as** ``required`` **.**

Custom Data
^^^^^^^^^^^

The registration form provides the ability to have custom fields defined by the developer. The registration controller will
automatically figure out which are those fields (i.e not part of the pre-defined properties supported by the Account) and
they will be added as `Custom Data`_ in the account.

For example, let's suppose we want to add a custom field to capture a user's birthday during registration. Then the
following properties should be added to the ``stormpath.properties`` file:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.type = text
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.label = Birthday
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.enabled = true
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.visible = true
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.required = true
    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.placeholder = Birthday

When the registration form is rendered, this field will be added to the bottom of the form.

   .. image:: /_static/register-with-birthday.png

When the form is submitted, the field's name and value will be added to the account's custom data.

If you want to provide user's with a good internationalization experience, then you should define the label property like this:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.label = stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.label

And then, in your ``i18n_en.properties`` file you would add:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.label = Birthday

While in your tentative ``i18n_es.properties`` file you would add:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.register.form.fields.birthday.label = Fecha de nacimiento

.. _password strength:

Password Strength
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you first fill out the registration form, you probably noticed that you couldn't register a user account without specifying a sufficiently strong password.  This is because, by default, Stormpath enforces certain password strength rules.

If you'd like to change these password strength rules, you can do so easily by visiting the `Stormpath Admin Console`_, navigating to your your application's user account ``Directory``, and then changing the "Password Strength Policy".

i18n
----

The :ref:`i18n` message keys used in the default register view have names prefixed with ``stormpath.web.register.``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../extensions/servlet/src/main/resources/com/stormpath/sdk/servlet/i18n.properties
   :language: properties
   :lines: 49-87

For more information on customizing i18n messages and adding bundle files, please see :ref:`i18n`.

.. _email verification:

Email Verification
------------------

Many applications require a newly registered user to verify that they do indeed 'own' the email address specified during registration before the user is allowed to login.  This helps ensure that:

* Email addresses cannot be abused by people that do not own them
* The application has a way of communicating with the user if necessary
* The registration process was completed by a human being (and not a 'bot' performing automatic registration, which could be used for malicious purposes).

If you want to enable email verification for newly registered accounts, you have to explicitly turn on this feature in the Stormpath Administration console:

#. Login to the `Stormpath Admin Console`_.

#. Click on the ``Directories`` tab and click the name of the Directory that will store accounts for your application.  If you created an application and automatically created a directory, the Directory name will be the same as the application name + ' Directory'.

   .. image:: /_static/console-directories-ann.png

#. On the resulting Directory screen, click on the Directory's ``Workflows`` menu item.

   .. image:: /_static/console-directory-ann.png

#. On the Directory Workflows screen, the 'Verification Email' workflow is shown first.  Ensure that you

   #. Enable the workflow, and
   #. Change the 'Link Base URL' text field to equal the fully qualified URL of your application's :ref:`verify link base URL <verify link base url>`.  The default context-relative path for this feature is ``/verify``, implying a base URL (for example, during localhost testing) of ``http://localhost:8080/verify``.

   .. image:: /_static/console-directory-workflows-ann.png

#. Click the 'Save Changes' button on the bottom right.

Try it!
^^^^^^^

#. Visit ``http://localhost:8080/register`` and you'll see the registration view:

   .. image:: /_static/register.png

#. Fill out the form and click submit, your account will be created with ``UNVERIFIED`` or ``ENABLED`` status depending on your `Directory Workflow <http://docs.stormpath.com/console/product-guide/#directory-workflows>`_:

    * Account status ``UNVERIFIED``:
        You will be redirected to the :ref:`login page <login>` with ``?status=unverified`` and you will receive a verification email.

        A) Open your email and, depending on your "Account Email Verification" email template, you should see an email that looks like the following:

           .. image:: /_static/register-verify-email.png

        B) Click the link in the email and it will take you to a ``/verify`` path.  This will verify your email address and redirect you to the :ref:`Verify Next URI`

            .. image:: /_static/login-verified.png

    * Account status ``ENABLED``:
        If ``autoLogin`` is true the application will log you in and redirect to register 'next' URI.
        If false you will be redirected to the :ref:`login page <login>` with ``?status=created``.

.. _verify link base url:

Verify Link Base URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Verify 'Link Base URL' mentioned above is the fully qualified base URL used to generate a unique link the user will click when reading the email.  For example, during development, this is often something like ``http://localhost:8080/verify`` and in production, something like ``https://myapp.com/verify``.

When a user clicks the link in the email, the |project| will automatically process the resulting request.  By default, the context-relative path that will process these requests is ``/verify`` as the above link examples show.  This path is controlled via the ``stormpath.web.verifyEmail.uri`` configuration property:

.. code-block:: properties

    stormpath.web.verifyEmail.uri = /verify

You can change the value to reflect a different path if you wish.

.. caution::
    The fully qualified Link Base URL configured in the Stormpath Admin Console must always reflect the path configured via ``stormpath.web.verifyEmail.uri``.  If you change one, you must change the other.

.. _verify next uri:

Verify Next URI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the user clicks the email verification link and the request is processed by the the ``stormpath.web.verifyEmail.uri`` path, the user will be:

    * If ``autoLogin`` is false (this is the default), redirected to a 'next' URI.  By default, this URI is the :ref:`login page <login>` as controlled by the ``stormpath.web.verifyEmail.nextUri`` configuration property:

        .. code-block:: properties

            stormpath.web.verifyEmail.autoLogin = false
            stormpath.web.verifyEmail.nextUri = /login?status=verified

        As you can see, this URI has a ``status=verified`` query parameter.  The plugin's default login view will recognize the query parameter and show the user a nice message explaining that their account has been verified and that they can log in:

        .. image:: /_static/login-verified.png

    * If ``autoLogin`` is true, the verification workflow will login the user and redirect to ``login.nextUri``

        .. code-block:: properties

            stormpath.web.verifyEmail.autoLogin = true
            stormpath.web.login.nextUri = /

Events
------

If you implement a :ref:`Request Event Listener <events>`, you can listen registration-related events and execute custom logic if desired.

Registered Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``RegisteredAccountRequestEvent`` will be published when processing an HTTP request that results in a newly registered ``Account``.  If the newly registered account requires email verification before it can login, ``event.getAccount().getStatus() == AccountStatus.UNDEFINED`` will be ``true``.

Verified Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``VerifiedAccountRequestEvent`` will be published when processing an HTTP request that verifies an account's email address.  The event's associated account is considered verified and may login to the application.

Naturally, **this event is only published if** :ref:`email verification <email verification>` **is enabled.**
