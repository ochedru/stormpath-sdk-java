The |project| is a drop-in plugin for `Spring Cloud Zuul`_ gateways that completely automates all user registration,
login, authentication, authorization and other security workloads for your application within the gateway.

This allows the Zuul gateway to perform all of this behavior so you don't have to add it to your applications!

The gateway will ensure the appropriate user context is forwarded to any applications behind the gateway as a
simple HTTP header that you can customize.
